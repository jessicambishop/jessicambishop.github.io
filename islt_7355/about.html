<h2>Hello, I’m Jessica!</h2>
    <p>I am a <strong>designer</strong> and <strong>writer</strong> focused on how learnability, storytelling, sensemaking, wayfinding, and removing barriers to learning can improve the learner’s experience.</p>
    <blockquote><strong>“The purpose of a storyteller is not to tell you how to think, but to give you questions to think upon.” — Brandon Sanderson</strong></blockquote>
<h2>Education and Experience</h2>
    <p>I am a graduate student in the <em>Learning Technologies and Design (LTD) program</em> and <em>User Experience and Usability (UXU) graduate certificate</em> at the University of Missouri. I plan to complete the program and certificate in Spring 2024. In 2005, I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Interdisciplinary Studies (Honors) from Rochester University. Additionally, I have completed a variety of design and writing certificates from organizations such as: Interaction Design Foundation, Cengage Learning, Spring Arbor University, Indiana University, Open2Study, and LinkedIn Learning.</p>
