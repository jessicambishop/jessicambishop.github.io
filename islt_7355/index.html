<h1>Welcome to my portfolio website!</h1>
    <p> I’m Jessica, an instructional designer and writer. This website highlights my experience as a graduate student of the Learning Technologies and Design (LTD) program and User Experience and Usability (UXU) graduate certificate at the University of Missouri. My studies allowed me to improve my evaluation and analysis skills; they showed me how great design comes from data collection, pilot testing, and iteration. This portfolio website aims to highlight my work that best exemplifies the LDT program and UXU certificate competencies. I chose the work I’m most proud of as I’ve worked toward the program and certificate competencies. </p>
        <p>The LTD program and UXU certificate provided opportunities to improve my design and development skills, provide feedback to and collaborate with my peers, immerse in real-life learning scenarios, and showcase my studies of interest. This site should help you gain a better understanding of my skills.</p>
