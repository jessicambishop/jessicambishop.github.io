    Hello, I’m Jessica! I’m a designer and writer focused on learnability, storytelling, sensemaking, wayfinding, and removing barriers to learning. I work at a private university. I live in Michigan with my husband, our three-year-old son, and two cats. 

    I am a graduate student in the Learning Technologies and Design (MS) program. I earned my BA in Interdisciplinary Studies (Honors). My prior experiences include an eclectic mix of retail, public libraries, technology, publishing, communications, and small business. 
    
    I started working with HTML and CSS in the mid-90s. I do not have formal training, but I’ve built several blogs and websites. This helps me when editing in our learning management system, team blog, and personal website. I’m looking forward to learning more so I can improve these sites. 
    
    When I’m not working, studying, or with family, I like to walk, read, and listen to music. I am currently writing a novel.
